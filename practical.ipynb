However, we will make our life a bit easier - we will continue to estimate GAMMs (or GAMMLSS) but act like we don't know how to do that and can only provide a log-likelihood function that we would like to optimize (as would be the case for a more general smooth model). This allows us to compare the estimates to the \"real\" GAMM estimates obtained so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with re-visiting the discussion of the log-likelihood of a GAMM from the lecture. In brief, for a GAMM we assume that each of our $N$ observations $y_i$ is a realization from a random variable $Y_i \\sim \\mathcal{E}(\\mu_i,\\phi)$ with mean $\\mu_i$ and scale parameter $\\phi$ (for a Gaussian additive model we assume that $\\mathcal{E} = N$ and $\\phi=\\sigma$). A function $g(\\mu_i)$ of $\\mu_i$ - the mean of the RVs - is modeled as an additive combination of smooth functions and parametric terms (the \"additive model part\"). That is, $g(\\mu_i)=\\eta_i=\\mathbf{X}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, where $\\eta_i$ is the model prediction for observation $y_i$, $\\mathbf{X}_i$ denotes row $i$ of model matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ holds all the weights/coefficients implied by the model of the mean. In contrast to $\\mu_i$ which can be different for every $Y_i$, $\\phi$ is assumed to be shared by all RVs!\n",
    "\n",
    "We further assume that all the $Y_i$ are mutually independent, because that makes computing the log-lieklihood easier (**Note**: the independence assumption is not **necessary** for more **general** smooth models). Specifically, if $p_{Y_i}(y_i|\\mu_i,\\phi)$ denotes the probability-density for observation $y_i$ given $\\mathcal{E}$, $\\mu_i$, and $\\phi$, the log-likelihood is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_i^N log(p_{Y_i}(y_i|\\mu_i,\\phi))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now treated as a function of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ instead of the data (remember: $\\mu_i = g^{-1}(\\mathbf{X}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = g^{-1}(\\eta_i)$).\n",
    "As discussed in the lecture, we can also represent (some function of) $\\phi$ as a product of a second model matrix $\\mathbf{Z}$ and a second coefficient vector! Specifically, we can write that $\\phi_i = g_\\phi^{-1}(\\mathbf{Z}_{i}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\phi)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a GAMM $\\phi_1 = \\phi_2 ... = \\phi_N=\\phi$, so $\\mathbf{X}_{\\phi,i}=1$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\phi$ will contain only a single coefficient (i.e., the estimate for $\\phi$) and this re-formulation is not necessary. However, when we express it like this we can immediately provide more complex models for $\\phi_i$ - allowing it to differ between $Y_i$ as well (explored in questions 11-12)."

    "The last model is actually just a \"Generalized additive model of location and scale\" - so we have more efficient means to estimate it. Re-use the ``formulas`` and ``links`` lists from exercise 11 and specify a Gaussian ``GAMMLSS`` model (check the [documentation](https://jokra1.github.io/mssm/mssm.src.python.html#module-mssm.src.python.exp_fam) for the family module to find out which family allows you to fit a Gaussian model in which we model both mean and standard deviation and the [documentation](https://jokra1.github.io/mssm/mssm.html#mssm.models.GAMMLSS) for the ``GAMMLSS`` class.). You can also try fitting a Gamma model, in which you again model mean and scale parameter.\n",
